                    <h4>Congratulations to the winners of the summer fishing tournament!</h4> 
                    <p>This year's tournament saw record attendance and fierce competition. 
                        Eight teams had bags weighing over 20 pounds, but James White and Bob Ford 
                        came to the scales with five bass weighing 28.7lbs. Their record catch earned 
                        them the first place prize of $1000. To see their fish and pictures of the 
                        event head over to the general forum page.
